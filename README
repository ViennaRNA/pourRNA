This project implement ParKin 1.0 and was started by 

  Gregor Entzian (c) 2014

  
To configure, compile and install do the following steps:
  - run ./configure [--help for additional configuration options]
  - run make
  - run make install
  
Dependencies:
  - ViennaRNA library
  - Energy Landscape Library
  - BIU Library
  
Known issues:
  - ParKin runs with maxThreads > 1 and is slower than with one thread, it could be that it runs on Windows.
    The problem is called Memory Contention. To solve this, one could use Linux where multiple allocations
    on the heap memory are allowed. Another way is to re-implement this tool with dedicated heaps for each thread.
    One could use HeapCreate from the Windows API or another HeapManager. The main function is the browseNeighs
    function from the ViennaRNA library, which is used in the floodalgorithm and in the gradientwalk.
